Game of Life
=========

Game of life is a programming and biology game.
You program a living creature and throw it out into the world, where it can compete against creatures made by other players.
The animals compete for resources, and can fight.

If your animal is successful, it will reproduce, passing your code to it's children, and eventually become a dominant strain of life on the simulated world.

What Animals can do?
===================

remember, look, smell, walk, eat, attack, reproduce, record a smell on a tile, and think.

You give them detailed instructions on how to live, and they obey. Their children will have the same instructions.
