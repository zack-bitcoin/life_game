To store memory, the VM has a main stack, a seconds stack, and it allows you to store variables.
Both stacks are LIFO stacks. Last in is first out.

These are the types of data that can be stored as variables, or on the stack:
*lists,
*binaries.

Lists can store other lists, and binaries.
If binaries are 32 bits long, then we can do arithmetic on them.
