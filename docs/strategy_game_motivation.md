I am a fan of strategy games, like civilization, or age of empires. What I like about the games is coming up with strategies and seeing if they work. What I don't like about these games is trying to execute on the strategy by focusing and clicking at the right times.

Some games have the ability to give your units more than one command, which hints at a better way to do things.

What if you don't have any control of your units after they are born. You just give them some detailed initial programming, and let them try to survive.
